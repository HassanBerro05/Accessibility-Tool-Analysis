# Conclusions and Recommendations

## Conclusions

The preceding analysis provided extensive information about the usage of UDOIT over the past two years, a structured summary of which is presented below:

- Between 1/1/2021 and 20/1/2023, UDOIT was scanned 731 times.
- The pandemic had a direct effect on the timing of scans. Most scans took place during Winter 2021 and Summer 2021.
- A large percentage of scans were executed before their intended semesters, almost as many as those run during their intended semesters.
- On a subaccount level, most scans were contributed by UMSN, LSA, and the School of Public Health, respectively.
- On a sub-subaccount level, most scans were attributed to UMSN graduate courses, English Language Institute, and Michigan Medicine HR, respectively.
- Most users running scans were staff rather than faculty.
- User 83, a staff member at the School of Nursing, was the main identified power user. Most power users were staff members.
- The scans included 211 courses at UM, most of which were academic at 135.
- Almost all courses that were scanned once needed remediation.
- Most courses that were scanned multiple times were remediated. Most of those were run by a single user.
- Most remediations were done by staff members.
- Not all possible UDOIT errors were detected in scans.
- Most detected scan errors pertained to table headers and alternative text for images.
- Most errors remediated pertained to alternative text for images. Most errors not remediated related to issues with video captions.
- Adjusting training to include course design could increase the efficacy of UDOIT.

In revealing who used the tool, how the tool was used, and when the tool was used, the analysis provided answers to all six RQ posed at the beginning of this project study. The analysis offers the necessary insight ITS needs to assess the efficacy of UDOIT as an accessibility tool at UM and should be key in driving ITS’ future efforts towards enhancing digital accessibility.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Training and Accessibility Awareness Programs**  
   To improve the adoption of UDOIT, particularly among faculty, a more robust and engaging training program should be implemented. These programs should emphasize the tool's practical benefits, such as time-saving features and its impact on accessibility. Additionally, workshops or seminars focusing on the importance of accessibility in education can address common misconceptions and highlight how tools like UDOIT contribute to an inclusive learning environment.

2. **Tool Upgrades and Feature Expansion**  
   Consider integrating additional features like support for external documents, automated remediation for more error types, and enhanced reporting capabilities. Collaborating with UDOIT developers or transitioning to a closed-source version with advanced functionalities may address current limitations.

3. **Incorporating Feedback Loops**  
   Regularly gather feedback from users to identify pain points and desired features. This can be achieved through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. The insights gained can guide the tool's iterative development and training programs.

4. **Advanced Analytics and Monitoring**  
   Develop dashboards or reports to monitor accessibility trends over time. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like error reduction rates, adoption rates, and course accessibility scores can provide actionable insights for continuous improvement.

5. **Cross-Departmental Collaboration**  
   Foster collaboration between departments to share best practices and resources. This can encourage a more unified approach to digital accessibility and broaden the tool's impact across the university.
