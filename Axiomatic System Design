<h1>Flint Water Crisis: Analytical Model for Lead Pipe Identification

## Executive Summary
The Flint Water Crisis of 2014 is an infamous incident that has endangered the lives of Flint residents and necessitated the tracking and elimination of lead-based water distribution systems. The city of Flint has launched an effort to identify and replace lead service lines, a task that has proven taxing given the shortage in financial resources and proper documentation. My goal is to aid with the inspection process by developing an analytical model based on a sample of over 20,000 Flint parcels to target the ones most likely to contain lead pipes. The dataset will be partitioned into a training set and a validation set. The ideal model will be identified based on the area under curve (AUC) of the Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve for the validation data.

For this study, I examined five different data mining techniques: Logistic Regression, Classification and Regression Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. My model of choice is an ensemble of three models: a simple neural network, a complex neural network, and a gradient boosting model. The chosen model was evaluated against each individual model. In comparison, the model exhibited the largest validation AUC with 96.40% and is, therefore, best suited for predicting parcels most likely to contain lead pipes.
