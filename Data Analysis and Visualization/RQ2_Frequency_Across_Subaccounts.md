# RQ2: Frequency Across Subaccounts

## Subaccount-Level Analysis
To investigate the number of scans across subaccounts, we analyzed the distribution of UDOIT scans over the past two years. 
The results, depicted in Figure 1, reveal the following key insights:
- The majority of scans originated from courses within the **University of Michigan School of XXXX**.
- The **College of LitXXXX)** ranks second, with scan counts decreasing rapidly beyond these top contributors.
- Collectively, the top two subaccounts account for approximately **57%** of all scans.

### Sub-subaccount-Level Analysis
Further analysis was conducted at the sub-subaccount level, representing specialized departments or units within schools or colleges 
(e.g., the English LXXXX within LSA). As shown in Figure 2:
- **UMSN Graduate XXXX**, a subset of UMSN, produced the highest number of scans.
- Completing the top three are **English LXXXX** (subset of LSA) and **Michigan MedXXXX** (subset of UMHR).

## Course-Level Insights
In addition to scan counts, we enumerated the number of unique courses associated with each subaccount and sub-subaccount. 
Out of 211 unique courses in the dataset, Figures 3 and 4 depict the top 10 subaccounts and sub-subaccounts by course count, respectively.

Key findings:
- The top subaccounts and sub-subaccounts by course count largely align with those by scan count.
- An exception is the **EpidXXXX Department**, which ranks third by course count but is surpassed by Michigan XXXX HR in scan frequency.
