# Scans and Users: RQ5

## Faculty-Staff Distinction (Figure 30)

RQ5 focuses on user interaction with UDOIT, particularly in understanding the types of users. The dataset distinguishes between **UM faculty** and **UM staff**, a classification highlighted in **C12**.  

Figure 30, derived from this distinction, reveals that **staff members outnumber faculty by more than three times** in the dataset.

## Most Frequent Users (Figure 31)

Figure 31 displays the **top 18 most frequent users**, defined as those who have executed at least **10 scans**. To maintain confidentiality, **user IDs are redacted and replaced with encrypted counterparts**.  

This visualization highlights:
- **Power users** and their scan frequencies.
- The **faculty/staff distinction** among these users.
- The **subaccounts** associated with each user.

### Key Insights:

- **User 26**, a **staff member at UMSN**, is the most frequent user, having executed **83 scans**.
- **User 7**, a **faculty member at LSA**, is the second most active user, with **55 scans**.
- **6 out of the top 18 users (33%)** are associated with **UMSN**, reinforcing its dominance in total scans.
- Only **3 faculty members** appear in the **top 18**, which aligns with the observation that staff users **significantly outnumber** faculty users in the dataset.

### Conclusion:

The data confirms that **UM staff play a much larger role in UDOIT scans** than faculty. The prevalence of **UMSN staff** among the top users is consistent with their overall high scan activity. These findings emphasize the need to consider user roles when evaluating engagement with UDOIT.
