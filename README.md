# Study of an Accessibility Tool for a Learning Management System at the University of Michigan

## Executive Summary
The University of Michigan is committed to providing a learning environment that is comprehensively accessible, as exemplified by the Electronic and Information (EIT) Standard Practice Guide (SPG) of 2022. To support its accessibility goals, the Information Technology Services (ITS) department endorsed the Universal Design Online Content Inspection Tool (UDOIT), an automated accessibility checker, in 2019.

This study leverages learning analytics to evaluate the efficacy of UDOIT in improving accessibility for online courses. Using Axiomatic System Design concepts, the research constructs a complete dataset from UDOIT output, answering predefined research questions with descriptive statistics and data visualizations. The findings guide ITS's future training efforts and inform strategies for enhancing digital accessibility at the University of Michigan.

## UDOIT Overview
UDOIT is an automated accessibility tool integrated into the Canvas Learning Management System. It scans course content for accessibility issues, identifies errors, and provides recommendations for remediation. While the tool has been available since 2019, its effectiveness had not been systematically evaluated until this study.

This research investigates UDOIT's usage patterns across semesters, colleges, and user types (faculty vs. staff). It also explores the types of errors detected and remediated, identifying barriers and facilitators to the tool's implementation and providing actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Research Purpose
• **RQ1**: How has the frequency of usage changed across semesters?

• **RQ2**: Are there any discernible usage patterns across different colleges/schools? 

• **RQ3**: What types of errors are the most common?

• **RQ4**: Are the errors being addressed by faculty and staff? 

• **RQ5**: Who are the power users? Are they faculty or staff? 

• **RQ6**: What are possible areas of improvement in UDOIT training for faculty and staff?
