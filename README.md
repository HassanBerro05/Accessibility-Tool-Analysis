# Study of an Accessibility Tool for a Learning Management System at the University of Michigan

## Executive Summary
The University of Michigan is committed to providing a learning environment that is comprehensively accessible, as exemplified by the Electronic and Information (EIT) Standard Practice Guide (SPG) of 2022. To support its accessibility goals, the Information Technology Services (ITS) department endorsed the Universal Design Online Content Inspection Tool (UDOIT), an automated accessibility checker, in 2019.

This study leverages learning analytics to evaluate the efficacy of UDOIT in improving accessibility for online courses. Using Axiomatic System Design concepts, the research constructs a complete dataset from UDOIT output, answering predefined research questions with descriptive statistics and data visualizations. The findings guide ITS's future training efforts and inform strategies for enhancing digital accessibility at the University of Michigan.
